Talk Title: Neural Program Synthesis

Abstract:
The key to attaining general artificial intelligence is to develop architectures that are capable of
learning complex algorithmic behaviors modeled as programs. The ability to learn programs allows these
architectures to learn to compose high-level abstractions with complex control-flow, which can lead to many
potential benefits: i) enable neural architectures to perform more complex tasks, ii) learn interpretable
representations (programs which can be analyzed, debugged, or modified), and iii) better generalization
to new inputs (like algorithms). In this talk, I will present some of our recent work in developing neural
architectures for learning complex regular-expression based data transformation programs from input-output examples,
and will also briefly discuss some other applications such as program repair and optimization that can benefit
from learning neural program representations.
